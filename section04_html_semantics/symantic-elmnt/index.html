        <h1>League of Legends</h1>
        <section>
            <p> League of Legends is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot
                Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to
                develop
                a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play,
                and
                is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows
                and
                macOS.

                In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and
                defending their own half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a
                "champion",
                with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by
                collecting experience points and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode,
                Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "nexus", a large
                structure located within it.

                League of Legends received generally positive reviews, critics highlighting its accessibility, character
                designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with
                reviews
                trending positively. The player base's negative and abusive in-game behavior, criticized since early in
                the
                game's lifetime, persists despite attempts by Riot to fix the problem. In 2019, the game regularly
                peaked at
                eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic
                books,
                short stories, and an upcoming animated series. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video
                games,
                including a mobile version and a digital collectible card game. A massively multiplayer online
                role-playing
                game is in development.

                The game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene composed
                of
                13 leagues. The 2019 League of Legends World Championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking
                at a
                concurrent viewership of 44 million, with a minimum prize pool of US$2.5 million. The North American
                league
                is broadcast on cable television sports channel ESPN.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, in which the player controls a
                character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric, or top-down, perspective.[4][5]
                Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by gaining experience points (XP) through killing
                non-player enemies called minions.[6] Items also increase the strength of champions,[7] and are bought
                using gold earned by killing minions,[4] or destroying enemy structures.[6][7] In the main game mode,
                Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their
                champion is in the team's base.[4] Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one
                match to another.[8]

            <h3>Summoner's Rift</h3>
            <p>
                Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in
                professional-level play.[9][10][11] The mode has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system
                determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are
                nine tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and
                Challenger.[12][a]

                Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's nexus, which is guarded by the enemy
                champions and defensive structures known as turrets.[14] Each team's nexus is located in their base,
                beside the "fountain"—where players start the game or reappear after a death.[14] Minions, which are not
                controlled by players, are generated from each team's three inhibitors. These inhibitors are structures
                located behind the third tower of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes
                stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane.[15] Minions advance toward the opposing team's base along
                three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.[16] In the "jungle"—the region between
                lanes—are "monsters" that, like minions, reappear at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide
                gold and XP when killed.[17] Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that
                separates each team's jungle.[18] These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special
                abilities to their slayers' team. For example, a team that slays Baron Nashor greatly increases the
                durability of their minions, making it difficult for enemy players to clear them.[19]

                Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.[20] The top and middle
                lanes have one champion each per side; the bottom lane has two. Players in a lane kill minions to
                accumulate gold and XP ("farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth
                champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their
                teammates in a lane.[21] Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have
                arisen over the game's lifetime.[4][22]
