    <p>The <b>crested gecko</b> or <b>eyelash gecko</b> (Correlophus ciliatus) is a species of gecko native to southern
        New
        Caledonia.
        In 1866, the crested gecko was described by a French zoologist named Alphone Guichenot. <sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup>  This species was
        thought
        extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 duricng an expedition led by Robert Seipp. <sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup> Along with several
        Rhacodactylus species, it is being considered for protected status by the Convention on the International Trade
        in
        Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. It is one of the most popular lizards in the pet trade, having grown
        substantially in popularity over the last decades <sup>[5]</sup>.
